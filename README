Features
Generate a pool of tickets with varying scores and sizes.
Assign tickets to gestores based on their current load and performance.
Resolve tickets and track the performance of each gestor.
Download the list of resolved tickets as a CSV file.
Display averages of ticket size and score for each gestor.
HTML Structure
The HTML file includes:

Head Section

Meta tags for character set and viewport settings.
Title of the website.
Link to Google Fonts for the Roboto font.
Internal CSS for styling.
Body Section

Container for the entire content.
Sections for generating the pool of tickets, displaying the pool, assigning tickets, displaying gestores, showing averages of resolved tickets, and listing resolved tickets.
Buttons for generating the pool, assigning tickets, and downloading resolved tickets as a CSV file.

Functions

generarPool(): Generates a pool of tickets and displays them.
crearBacklog(numTickets): Creates a backlog of tickets.
mostrarPool(pool): Displays the pool of tickets.
autoAdjustFontSize(element): Adjusts the font size of ticket elements to fit within their bounds.
creaGestores(numGestores): Creates an array of gestores.

mostrarTickets(gestor): Displays the tickets assigned to a gestor.
asignarTicket(): Assigns one ticket at a time from the pool to the gestor with the least tickets. If there are multiple gestores with the same number of tickets, it calculates SizeDistance and RiskDistance to determine the best gestor.
resolverTicket(secuencial, gestorId): Resolves a ticket and moves it to the resolved tickets list.
calculateAverage(arr, prop): Calculates the average of a specified property for an array of objects.
updatePromediosTable(): Updates the table displaying average size and score of resolved tickets per gestor.
downloadCSV(): Generates and downloads a CSV file of resolved tickets.
Usage Instructions
Generate Pool of Tickets

Click the "Generar Pool De Casos" button to generate a pool of tickets. This will display the pool in the "Pool" section.
Assign Tickets

Click the "Asignar Ticket" button to assign one ticket from the pool to the gestor with the least tickets. If there are multiple gestores with the same number of tickets, the system will use SizeDistance and RiskDistance to determine the best gestor.
Resolve Tickets

Click the "Resolver" button next to a ticket to resolve it. Resolved tickets are moved to the "Resueltos" section.
View Averages

The "Promedio de tickets resueltos por Gestor" section displays the average size and score of resolved tickets for each gestor.
Download CSV

Click the "Descargar Resueltos CSV" button to download a CSV file containing all resolved tickets.
Notes
The conversion of scores is as follows: "High" = 3, "Medium" = 2, "Low" = 1.
Ensure that all buttons and functionality are tested for proper operation.
